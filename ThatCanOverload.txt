Operators That Can Be Overloaded:
Scope resolution operator (::)
Member access operator (.)
Conditional (ternary) operator (?:)
Sizeof operator (sizeof)
Typeid operator (typeid)
Alignof operator (alignof)
Noexcept operator (noexcept)
New and delete operators (new, delete, new[], delete[]) for placement new and global scope
Operators That Can Be Overloaded:
Member pointer access operator (->*)
Pointer-to-member operator (->)
Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, etc.)
Relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
Increment and decrement operators (++, --)
Subscript operator ([])
Function call operator (())
Comma operator (,)
Dereference operator (*)
